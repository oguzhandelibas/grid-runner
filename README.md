# grid-runner

Hello, two different mechanics have been tested within this project.

1- Grid Game: It is based on clicking on the objects in our dynamically created grid system and matching 3 of them.

2- Stack Runner Game: It deals with stacking the platform in front of our character as he progresses along the platform to prevent him from falling. Timing is important for this game.

I would be very happy if you could examine my work and give me positive or negative feedback.
